Flashy Words
By Shihan

Flashy words make the world turn but it don't turn right [x2]
So I use these real eyes to realize the real lies being spoken but not heard cause
We are more fascinated by that which are fabricated
The iconoclastic tactless tactician aims tongues spits truth
Words like wrecking balls bounce off brains cause nobody likes to hear what's going on these days

It's like, the truth hurts
And we've been lied to
A bunch of hollowed minds living on borrowed times
And nobody likes to hear that and
Nobody likes to say it either
Cause lazy angels never carry their wings and
Wingless words do nothing but keep us down

So this New York poet yells,
"There is no satisfaction in knowing that your life is one of the saddest fictions ever written"
So take your not so satisfactory life back to the sadness factory to
Be reworked and
Be rewritten and
Be reconfigured to live right

Open your brain
Let your heart go
The real you has been locked within your rib cage too long
And stop trying to hold onto then because that's why it all started
And about that same time he forgot fun
She lost hope
And now we can't find anything

Words
Break these words down to the syllables they are
Or the silly bulls they represent
And what do I represent?
Well it's hard to say when my rep resents the fact that I have to question myself
Or each time that question represents itself

I can, therefore I am and
Stick and stones may break your bones
But words will always teach you.
